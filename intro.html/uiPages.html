          <p>
            A lion is a wild animal which lives in jungle. He is one of the
            strongest animals. He is called as “King of the Jungle” due to his
            huge size, power and attacking nature. Today lions are found in
            sub-Saharan part of Africa and in Asia. They are represented as a
            symbol of pride, courage, glory and fearlessness. In ancient times,
            people, especially kings, used to hunt lions and keep their skin to
            show their courage and vigour to their enemies.

            “No one in this physical world has the power to hold you, you are
            the one holding on, and you are the one who has to let go.” “The
            only way to calm anger is to shift our focus: instead of
            contemplating what duty others have towards us, we should consider
            what duties we have towards them.” “The true path to enlightenment
            lies within oneself. Look inward, and you shall find the light you
            seek.” “Your faith, your trust, your belief, and your contemplation
            are what will enable your welfare. If your conduct is immoral then
            no blessings will work.”
